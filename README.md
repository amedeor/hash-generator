# hash-generator

## Project description

An application that generates an MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, or SHA-512 hash on a selected file. The generated hash can be compared with another hash to determine if they match.

I created this project to practice building Java Swing applications.

(This project is a work in progress.)
